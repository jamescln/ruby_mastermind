# Mastermind

## Objective

I will create a version of the game _Mastermind_ using Ruby. The game will be
played in the command line.

The first version of the game will involve the computer setting a code and the
player attempting to crack it in 12 turns. The computer will provide feedback
on how accurate each guess was.

The second version of the game will allow the player to set the code and the
computer will attempt to crack the code by following an algorithm.

## Learning Outcomes

I will further my knowledge on Ruby I/O and alogrithms. I also want to
reinforce my knowledge of the Ruby Style Guide and testing with Rspec.
